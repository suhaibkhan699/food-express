# FoodExpress

Developed a food delivery application by utilizing the real-time Swiggy APIs. To ensure a positive user experience, they implemented user-friendly features such as lazy loading and shimmer UI. These features enhanced the app's functionality and made it easier for users to navigate. Currently, working on integrating more features such as search and add to cart, which will further improve the app's functionality and convenience for users.
